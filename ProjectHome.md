# What is this #
In the good old IPv4 network you might need portforwarding now and then to make services visible on the outside.

Instead of editing your routers firewall settings you can also use this application, if your router has NAT UPnP.

With this tool you can make and delete portforwarding rules on the fly!

# Current status #
At the moment it works on Windows.
I've not fully tested it on Linux yet with the Mono project.

Because the current implementation of the library is somewhat limited for developers I plan to change some things.

Things that will add more features and make the current code less messy.

You can download the program by going to the [downloads section](http://code.google.com/p/csharp-upnp-portmapper/downloads/list)
